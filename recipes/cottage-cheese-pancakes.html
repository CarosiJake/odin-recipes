    <h1>Simple Cottage Cheese Pancakes Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/pancakes.jpg" alt="Pancake Picture" height="310" width="310">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These pancakes are an old favorite of mine. I use small-curd, low-fat cottage cheese.
    They come out thin and delicate, somewhere between a classic pancake and a crepe.
    A nice addition to a reduced-carb diet.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup of cottage cheese</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon butter, or as needed</li>
      <li>1/4 cup blueberries, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Strain cottage cheese in a sieve fitted over a bowl, pressing down occasionally,
      until cottage cheese has dried out, about 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Beat eggs in a medium bowl; add cottage cheese, flour, melted butter, and salt.
      Mix until just blended.</li>
      <li>Heat butter in a frying pan over medium-heat; drop large spoonfuls of batter into the melted butter.
      Sprinkle blueberries into batter. Cook until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
    </ol>
